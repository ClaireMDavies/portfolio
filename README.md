# Responsive Portfolio <br>

## Explanation of the Portfolio <br>
Creating a three page website with pages giving some background information about myself, contact details along with a resume download button and a portfolio page detailing some recent work.  This gives a central location to bring together all aspects of my development as a full stack developer, and includes links to GitHub and LinkedIn<br>
